snowcrest
=========

We love Christmas here at Wild Boy Design. Almost as much as we love Inbound Marketing. In honor of the season, we've created a fun jQuery plug-in to help your site get into the spirit of Christmas. It's a simple install, but there are a few disclaimers in order:

* We have not thoroughly tested this and as such it is officially ALPHA software. Use at your own risk.
* We will continue to refine this as time progresses, so check back for an update
* Feel free to fork and use it however you want


## Installation

There are two files that are necessary for the script to work properly: a CSS file and a Javascript file. Include script *after* the jQuery library:

    <script src="/path/to/jquery.snowcrest-0.1a.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/jquery.snowcrest-0.1a.css">

You also need to include a small snippet to initialize the plug-in somwhere.

    <script type="text/javascript">
    	$('body').snowcrest();
    </script>

And then you're done! Snow should be falling from the top of the screen.
